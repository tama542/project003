        <h1><u>Seasonal Planting Guidelines</u></h1>
        <p>It’s possible to grow a magnificent garden. <br>
            All you need is a good understanding of what makes each season unique.
            <br>You’ll need to know how to work with seasonal conditions, not against them.
            <br>Thinking ahead to seasonal transitions is also important when it comes seasonal growing.
            <br>This means considering not only what plants are in season now, but which ones you can plant today
            for later blooms.
        </p>
        <p>Here’s a high-level look at the different planting seasons and what factors to consider as you build out
            your seasonal garden:</p>

        <br><br>
        <ul>

            <li> <b><u>Spring:</u></b>During the spring, the ground warms up and becomes easier to dig in. <br>Spring
                gardening is
                refreshing and revitalizing as bulbs planted in the fall or early winter start to come to life.
                Spring is also a time to plant perennials and await their bursts of vibrant color as summer nears.

        <ul>
            <li> <b><u>Summer:</u></b> With frost well behind you, annual flowering plants can now take hold in warmer
                ground. <br> Summer is arguably the season that gardeners wait all year for as showy summer flowers
                bloom. You can even plan for late summer flowers to keep the colorful array of plants going strong into
                the fall.</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li><b><u>Fall: </u></b>Fall is a transition season that gives gardeners the opportunity to plan for early
                spring blooms. It’s also a season for gardeners to try their hand at planting trees and shrubs that will
                eventually head into a dormant stage. Seize on fall ground conditions before the soil becomes too hard
                or waterlogged.</li>
