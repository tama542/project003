    <h1><b><u>Pest Control Tips</u></b></h1>
    <p>When you start searching for 'pest control' recommendations, you're likely to find all kinds of harsh chemical products,<br> articles filled with misleading info, and images of people spraying pesticides around their homes.
        But how do you protect your home from pests <br>,without the use of harsh chemicals? What are the safest and most effective ways to find pests and keep them outside and away from your house? <br> This simple guide will help you know exactly what steps you should take to start managing and preventing pest populations around your home.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Not all pest resources are created equal, and many pest control company websites are actually written by marketing pros, not pest professionals. <br>Unless the site you're using was written by a professional with pest control experience, be wary of their recommendations, especially ones that involve <br>the application of products (even natural ones like diatomaceous earth and essential oils).</p>
        <br>

   <p>Before performing your own pest control, it's important to get into the right mindset. Approach pest control with patience and understand that it might take some time <br>to get control of an issue. Pest control is a long-term goal, not a short-term fix.
    Start by thinking about your pest issue. Think about when the activity started,<br> where you're seeing it, what time of day the pests are active, and what could be attracting the pests to your home in the first place. <br>
    Depending on the pest, you're going to need to be prepared to get dirty, climb ladders, access small, dark spaces like the attic or crawlspace, and potentially use some tools to get the job finished.</p>

        <li>Pants</li>
        <li>Long sleeves</li>
        <li>Gloves</li>
        <li>Mask</li>
        <li>Eye Protection</li>
